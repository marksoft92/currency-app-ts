1. Create a new React.js project and set up the necessary components and files.
2. Fetch data from an API endpoint (e.g. Google Books API or other preferable free API).
3. Build the dynamic table component that renders the fetched data with multiple columns
listing some authors.
4. Implement row selection functionality that highlights the selected row.
5. Display detailed data specific to the selected row in the table or a separate section,
showing books written by this author.
6. Implement breadcrumb functionality to show the selected row's path or hierarchy.
7. Handle breadcrumb navigation to allow the user to go back to previous levels.
8. Apply appropriate styling using CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) to
make the application visually appealing.
9. Test the application to ensure all components and functionality work as expected.
